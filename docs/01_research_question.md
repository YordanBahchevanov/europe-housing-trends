# Research Question & Hypothesis

## Research Question
Are house price increases in **Bulgaria** more strongly decoupled from **net earnings** than in the rest of **Europe**?

## Hypothesis
- **H0 (null):**  
  The relationship between HPI and net earnings in Bulgaria is similar to the European average.

- **H1 (alternative):**  
  Bulgariaâ€™s HPI growth is less explained by net earnings compared to the European average, suggesting reduced affordability and stronger speculative/inflationary dynamics.
