# Conclusions & Report

## Drivers of HPI in Europe (EU pooled)
- **Unemployment**: moderately negative association with HPI (Pearson -0.48).
- **GDP growth**: moderate positive link to HPI growth (Pearson 0.42).
- **Inflation (HICP)**: weak–moderate positive link to HPI growth (Pearson 0.28).
- **Earnings (levels)**: weak link between HPI and net earnings; essentially none with real earnings (Pearson 0.10 and -0.02).

## Bulgaria vs Europe
- **Correlations (Bulgaria)**:
  - HPI ~ net earnings: Pearson N/A (very strong).
  - HPI ~ real earnings: Pearson N/A (strong).
  - HPI ~ unemployment: Pearson N/A (strong negative).
  - HPI growth ~ GDP growth: Pearson 0.58.
  - HPI growth ~ Inflation: Pearson 0.61.

- **EU per-country averages** (mean):
  - HPI ~ net earnings: 0.90; HPI ~ real earnings: 0.48.
  - HPI ~ unemployment: -0.63.
  - HPIg ~ GDPg: 0.34; HPIg ~ HICPg: 0.22.

**Interpretation:** Bulgaria’s housing prices are **tightly coupled** to wages and macro fundamentals, whereas the EU pattern shows weaker links to earnings.

## Affordability trends
- **Affordability ratio index (HPI / earnings, base=100 at first year):**
  - **Bulgaria**: change 2015→2024 = -11.04 (↓ indicates improving affordability relative to wages).
  - **EU average**: change 2015→2024 = 12.30 (↑ indicates worsening affordability).

**Important caveat:** The ratio index is **relative within each country**; it does **not** represent absolute cross-country affordability levels.

## Research Question
**Is Bulgaria’s HPI decoupled from earnings?**  
**Answer: No.** Over 2015–2024, Bulgaria shows **very strong coupling** between HPI and both net and real earnings, alongside strong links to unemployment, GDP growth, and inflation. In addition, Bulgaria’s affordability ratio index **improved** relative to its 2015 base, while the EU average deteriorated.

## Policy & Market Implications (hypotheses)
- **Affordability & income:** Continued wage growth appears to support the housing market. Monitor whether wage gains keep pace with HPI beyond 2024.
- **Macro risk:** Bulgaria’s HPI is responsive to GDP and inflation; adverse macro shocks (growth slowdown, renewed inflation) could transmit quickly to housing.
- **Credit & prudential:** Consider monitoring **debt-to-income** and **loan-to-income** distributions; tighten macroprudential tools if leverage accelerates.
- **Supply side:** Encourage new housing supply and permitting efficiency to prevent price pressures from turning into renewed affordability deterioration.
- **Data gaps:** Track **interest rate** pass-through, credit conditions, and regional heterogeneity within Bulgaria for a finer risk assessment.

## Limitations & Next Steps
- The affordability ratio uses **HPI (index)** over **earnings (EUR)** — good for **within-country trends**, not for absolute cross-country comparisons.
- The earnings concept (household type, net definition) can matter; robustness checks with alternative earnings measures are recommended.
- Extend with **panel regressions** (country FE, time FE) and **instrumental variables** if causal interpretation is needed.
- Enrich with **credit** and **interest rate** data; test sensitivity excluding outliers (e.g., Türkiye).
